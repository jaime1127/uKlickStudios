You will meet with your artist on a set day and time for approximately 1/2 hour in order to review your vision as well as its location, sizing and details. If your tattoo appointment isnâ€™t already booked, your tattooist will schedule you by the end of your consultation. It is also not uncommon for your artist to request you put down a deposit at this time in order to hold the spot.'
